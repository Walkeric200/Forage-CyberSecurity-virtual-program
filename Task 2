Here you have one zip file named "EncryptedFilePack".
First, unzip the above file.
Inside the file is one zip file named enc.zip and one brute-force Python script that is not entirely complete.
Modify the code, then, using the code, unzip the "enc.zip" file, and then submit the code in the submit section.
To unzip the file, use the rockyou.txt file in the brute-force Python script.
